# Python Basics Examples 

### Jupyter Notebooks Code Examples :snake: 

In this repository I added a number of jupyter notebooks with code examples and exercises for python.

**It contains:**

- `data` sample used in the exercises
- `numpy` exercises and examples
- `pandas` exercises and code examples
- `python-baics` with a introduction examples of python
- `python-lambda` a group of exercises using lambda functions


*This collection of exercises came from my own studies and trainings I have done during the past years.*
